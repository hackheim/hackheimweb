There are a wide range of materials that laser cutters can cut, etch, or mark - but some simply don't work and **some are extremely hazardous** to either humans or the machine itself.

**⚠️ It is imperative that you check these lists before attempting to cut materials you haven't worked with before.**

## Important Notes

It's not always obvious which materials will work. For example:

- **Polycarbonate sheets (Lexan)** produce flames and toxic soot that ruins optics and is hazardous to health
- **Acrylic** - which looks and feels like Lexan - cuts smoothly and cleanly and is one of the best materials to use!

**Testing tip:** Acrylic is not very flexible at normal temperatures. Polycarbonate is slightly bendable in thicknesses under 1 inch.

## 🚫 NEVER CUT THESE MATERIALS

**⚠️ WARNING:** Many plastics are dangerous to cut. It's important to know what kind you're planning to use.

| Material | Danger | Consequence |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **PVC/Vinyl/Pleather** | Emits chlorine gas! | Will ruin optics, corrode machine metal, destroy motion control system |
| **Thick Polycarbonate/Lexan** (>1mm) | Cuts poorly, catches fire | Creates stringy soot clouds that ruin optics and mess up machine |
| **ABS Plastic** | Melts / Emits cyanide | Doesn't vaporize properly, creates gooey deposits, emits toxic hydrogen cyanide |
| **HDPE** (milk bottles) | Catches fire and melts | Gets gooey, catches fire easily |
| **Polystyrene Foam** | Catches fire | **#1 cause of laser fires!** Burns rapidly and melts |
| **Polypropylene Foam** | Catches fire | Melts, burns, creates rock-hard burning drips |
| **Epoxy** | Toxic fumes | Creates cyanide-like toxic fumes when burned |
| **Fiberglass** | Toxic fumes | Mix of glass and epoxy - both problematic |
| **Coated Carbon Fiber** | Noxious fumes | Coating creates toxic fumes (uncoated thin carbon fiber may be OK) |
| **Food items** | Contamination | Laser not designed for food - creates toxic environment |
| **Materials with sticky backing** | Destroys lens | Glue vaporizes and coats/cracks the lens - very expensive to replace |

## ✅ Safe Materials

The laser can **cut** materials like wood, paper, cork, and some plastics. **Etching** can be done on almost anything - wood, cardboard, aluminum, stainless steel, plastic, marble, stone, tile, and glass.

### Cutting Materials

| Material | Max Thickness | Notes | Warnings |
|----------|---------------|-------|----------|
| **Many woods** | 1/4" | Avoid oily/resinous woods | Watch for fire with resinous woods |
| **Plywood/Composite woods** | 1/4" | Contains glue, may not cut as cleanly | |
| **MDF/Engineered woods** | 1/4" | May experience more charring | |
| **Paper/Card stock** | Thin | Cuts very well and quickly | |
| **Cardboard** | Thicker | Cuts well | Watch for fire |
| **Cork** | 1/8" | Quality depends on thickness/type | Avoid thick cork (5mm+). Engraves better than cuts |
| **Acrylic/Plexiglas/PMMA** | 1/2" | **Excellent material** - cuts with polished edge | |
| **Thin Polycarbonate** | \<1mm | Tends to discolor badly | Watch for smoking/burning |
| **Delrin (POM)** | Thin | Harder grades work better. Great for gears! | |
| **Kapton tape** | 1/16" | Works well in thin sheets | |
| **Mylar** | 1/16" | Thin works well, thick tends to warp | Gold coated mylar won't work |
| **Solid Styrene** | 1/16" | Smokes a lot when cut | Keep it thin |
| **Depron foam** | 1/4" | Used for RC aircraft, models. Cuts with smooth edge | Must be constantly monitored |
| **Gator foam** | Thin | Foam core burns away vs paper shell | Watch carefully - not ideal |
| **Cloth/Felt/Cotton** | Varies | All cut well - can do lace-making | Not plastic coated cloth! |
| **Real Leather/Suede** | 1/8" | Hard to cut, requires advanced training | Real leather only - no pleather (PVC)! |
| **Magnetic Sheet** | Standard | Cuts beautifully | |
| **Non-chlorine Rubber** | Varies | Fine for cutting | Beware chlorine-containing rubber! |
| **Teflon (PTFE)** | Thin | OK in thin sheets | |
| **Uncoated Carbon Fiber** | Thin | Can be cut slowly with some fraying | Must NOT be epoxy coated! |
| **Coroplast** | 1/4" | Difficult due to vertical strips | Multiple passes needed |
### Etching Materials

All the above "cuttable" materials can be etched, in some cases very deeply.

**Additional materials that can be etched:**

| Material | Notes | Warnings |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Glass** | Green glass works best - looks sandblasted | Flat glass only - round objects will have distortion |
| **Ceramic tile** | Works well | |
| **Anodized aluminum** | Vaporizes the anodization away | |
| **Painted/coated metals** | Vaporizes the paint/coating away | |
| **Stone/Marble/Granite** | Gets white "textured" look when etched | 100% power, 50% speed or less works well |

### Marking with Cermark

**Cermark** is a marking compound containing molybdenum (~$50-100 for 12oz spray can) that can be sprayed onto metals and other surfaces before laser etching to create **permanent dark black marks**.

**Compatible surfaces:**
- Stainless steel, brass, aluminum, copper, nickel
- Glass
- Light-colored stone/tile

**Alternative:** Some people have success using dry moly lube spray for similar results.
