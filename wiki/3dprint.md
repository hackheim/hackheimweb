Can I use the gun? Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Tell her she looks thin. Fry, we have a crate to deliver.

Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? It's a T. __It goes "tuh".__ *Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas!* They work here in the Slurm factory.

No, she'll probably make me do it. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? I wish! It's a nickel. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

* This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!
* Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.
* Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.

And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Fry, we have a crate to deliver. And I'm his friend Jesus. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.

OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Hello Morbo, how's the family? You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me!

I just told you! You've killed me! Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Large bet on myself in round one.

Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Why did you bring us here? Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. It's toe-tappingly tragic! Throw her in the brig. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.

Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Can I use the gun? Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!

File not found. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.

They're like sex, except I'm having them! OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Moving along…

Oh yeah, good luck with that. When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.

Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. And until then, I can never die? What are their names? Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?

Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.

1. Why did you bring us here?
2. Yes! In your face, Gandhi!
3. No, she'll probably make me do it.
